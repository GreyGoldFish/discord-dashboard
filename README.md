# Discord-Inspired Dashboard

This project is a dashboard with a user interface inspired by Discord. It was created as a learning exercise to practice using Tailwind CSS.

The project is based on the [tailwind-dashboard](https://github.com/fireship-io/tailwind-dashboard) repository from Fireship.io. The original was built with React, and this version has been adapted to use the Eleventy static site generator.
